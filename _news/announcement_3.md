I published a new manuscript on reproducibility of codes in numerical relativity with Einstein Toolkit and IllinoisGRMHD. The paper is now published on Classical and Quantum Gravity.

Numerical Relativity (NR) aims to solve Einstein's equations using computers to probe some physical characteristics of compact objects. Nowadays, NR simulations are fairly complex and usually are run on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Since reproducible result is a key component in any domain of science, our project focuses on studying the computational reprodcibility of numerical relativity code. We conducted a use-case study with the IllinoisGRMHD and Einstein Toolkit.
